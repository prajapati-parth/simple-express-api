# simple-express-api
To get started:
- Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/prajapati-parth/simple-express-api.git
```
- Install npm packages
```
npm install
```
- Make sure you replace the url value in /config/db.js
- Run the server
```
npm run dev
```

#### Note:
I've used [nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon) to avoid restarting the server manually after change in file. This is helpful for developers coming from PHP background.
